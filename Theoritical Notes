Algorithm: method for solving a problem.
Data structure: method to store information.

1. data types - stack, queue, bag, union-find, priority queue
2. sorting -  quicksort, mergesort, heapsort
3. searching -  BST, red-black BST, hash table
4. graphs - BFS, DFS, Prim, Kruskal, Dijkstra
5. strings - radix sorts, tries, KMP, regexps, data compression
6. advanced - B-tree, suffix array, maxflow

Steps to developing a usable algorithm.
・Model the problem.
・Find an algorithm to solve it.
・Fast enough? Fits in memory?
・If not, figure out why.
・Find a way to address the problem.
・Iterate until satisfied.

Given a set of N objects.
・Union command: connect two objects.
・Find/connected query: is there a path connecting the two objects?

*****Now, the algorithms that we're looking at today are not going to actually give the path connecting the two objects. 
*****It's just going to be able to answer the question, is there a path? In part two of the course, we'll consider algorithms that explicitly find paths. 
*****They're not as efficient as union find because they have more work to do.


Applications involve manipulating objects of all types.
・Pixels in a digital photo.
・Computers in a network.
・Friends in a social network.
・Transistors in a computer chip.
・Elements in a mathematical set.
・Variable names in Fortran program.
・Metallic sites in a composite system.

When programming, convenient to name objects 0 to N –1.
・Use integers as array index.
・Suppress details not relevant to union-find...................can use symbol table to translate from site names to integers

****In fact, to make this mapping from an object name to the integer zero through N - one is to find application of a symbol table or a searching algorithm, 
which is one of the things that we'll be studying later in this course algorithms and data structures for solving that problem. 

We assume "is connected to" is an equivalence relation:
・Reflexive: p is connected to p.
・Symmetric: if p is connected to q, then q is connected to p.
・Transitive: if p is connected to q and q is connected to r,
then p is connected to r.

****Connected components. Maximal set of objects that are mutually connected.
****Our algorithms will gain efficiency by maintaining connected components and using that knowledge to efficiently answer the query that's, that they're presented with.

Implementing the operations:
1. Find query- Check if two objects are in the same component.
2. Union command- Replace components containing two objects with their union

Union-find data type (API)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

****All of that leads up to, in a programming world to specifying, a data type which is simply 
specification of the methods that we are want to going to implement in order to solve this problem.

Goal. Design efficient data structure for union-find.
・Number of objects N can be huge.
・Number of operations M can be huge.
・Find queries and union commands may be intermixed.

public class UF:
---------------
UF(int N)                                 - initialize union-find data structure with N objects (0 to N – 1)
void union(int p, int q)                  - add connection between p and q
boolean connected(int p, int q)           - are p and q in the same component?
int find(int p)                           - component identifier for p (0 to N – 1)
int count()                               - number of components

****Typical Java model, what we will do is create a class called UF that contains two methods, one to implement union, the other one to implement connected, which returns a boolean. 
The constructor, takes SR unit, the number of objects, so that it can build data structure based on the number of objects.


Dynamic-connectivity client:    (client = program)
----------------------------
・Read in number of objects N from standard input.
・Repeat:
– read in pair of integers from standard input
– if they are not yet connected, connect them and print out pair

How many connected components result after performing the following sequence of union operations on a set of  10  items?
1–2  3–4  5–6  7–8  7–9  2–8  0–5  1–9 

The connected components are {0, 5, 6}, {3,4}, and {1,2,7,8,9}.

Quick-Find:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Now we'll look at our first implementation of an algorithm for solving the dynamic connectivity problem, called Quick-find. 
This is a so called eager algorithm, for solving kind activity problem.

Data structure.
・Integer array id[] of length N.
・Interpretation: p and q are connected iff(if and only if) they have the same id.

id[]= {0 1 1 8 8 0 0 1 8 8}       
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0, 5 and 6 are connected
1, 2, and 7 are connected
3, 4, 8, and 9 are connected

So that representation is, shows that they're connected. 
And clearly, that's going to support a quick implementation of the find operation. 
We just check the array entries to see if they're equal.

|| Find. Check if p and q have the same id.
         id[6] = 0; id[1] = 1
         6 and 1 are not connected

|| Union. To merge components containing p and q, change all entries whose id equals id[p] to id[q].
